## Composer Usage ##

We are using a package published by Microsoft.  You can find it on [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/microsoft/application-insights). In order to use it, first, you'll need to get [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/). 

Once you've setup your project to use Composer, just add a reference to our package with whichever version you'd like to use to your composer.json file.

```json
require: "microsoft/application-insights": "*"
```

Make sure you add the require statement to pull in the library:

```php
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';
```
